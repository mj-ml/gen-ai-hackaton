Even after bio microscopy, laboratory tests are often necessary if proof of etiology is needed.\\n\\nA purulent discharge (a whitish-yellow, yellow or yellow- brown substance, more commonly known as pus) suggests a bacterial infection. It can also be caused by bacteria from feces, pet hair, or by smoke or other fumes. Infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae should be suspected if the discharge is particularly thick and copious.\\n\\nThe diagnosis is usually made on history and eye examination. This should include staining the eyes, testing acuity, checking the anterior chamber for clarity (as far as possible with a handheld ophthalmoscope) and everting the lids to look for foreign bodies and examining the underside of the eyelids. Investigations and/or referral are only indicated if there is any doubt in the diagnosis. Investigations may include conjunctival swabs, skin prick testing, serum immunoglo-bulin E (IgE) and Radio Allegro Sorbent test (RAST).\\n\\nItching (rubbing eyes) is the hallmark symptom of allergic conjunctivitis. Other symptoms include history of eczema, or asthma.\\n\\nA diffuse, less \"injected\" conjunctivitis (looking pink rather than red) suggests a viral cause, especially if numerous follicles are present on the lower tarsal conjunctiva on bio microscopy.\\n\\nTypes of Allergic Conjunctivitis\\n\\nThere are six recognized types of allergic conjunctivitis: seasonal, perennial, drug-induced, contact lens-induced, vernal and atopic. The first four are caused by type 1 hypersensitivity reactions Baran, 2014). (\\n\\nConjunctivitis due to type 1 hypersensitivity reactions\\n\\nScarring of the tarsal conjunctiva suggests trachoma, especially if seen in endemic areas, if the scarring is linear (Arlt\\'s line), or if there is also corneal vascularization.\\n\\nClinical tests for lagophthalmos, dry eye (Schirmer test) and unstable tear film may help distinguish the various types of conjunctivitis.\\n\\nSeasonal conjunctivitis: (aka conjunctivitis associated with hay fever) the most common allergen is pollen. Grass pollens peak from May to August whereas tree pollens tend to peak on either side of this period, depending on the tree species involved. Individual patients may have multiple allergies, but their symptoms tend to recur at the same time each year.\\n\\nOther symptoms, including pain, blurring of vision and photophobia, should not be prominent in conjunctivitis. Fluctuating blurring is common, due to tearing and mucoid discharge. Mild photophobia is common. However, if any of these symptoms are prominent, it is important to consider other diseases such as glaucoma, uveitis, keratitis and evenmeningitis or carotico-cavernous fistula.\\n\\nMany people with conjunctivitis have trouble opening their eyes in the morning because of the dried mucus on their eyelids. There is often excess mucus over the eye after sleeping for an extended period (Mark, 1996).\\n\\nPerennial conjunctivitis: It is the conjunctivitis where symptoms occurs throughout the year in response to various allergens such as animal dander and house dust mites. Symptoms may be worse in the mornings.\\n\\nGiant papillary conjunctivitis: The common causes include contact lenses, and (broken) sutures and prostheses following eye surgery. This is the most severe form of contact lens-associated papillary conjunctivitis. It is seen in contact lens and prosthesis users. However, the widespread use of disposable contact lenses has reduced its incidence.'}, page_content='The text discusses the differential diagnosis and investigations for conjunctivitis.

Allergic Conjunctivitis is the cause of around 15% of all eye problems presenting in general practice.\\n\\nSeasonal allergic conjunctivitis and perennial allergic conjunctivitis are often associated with a family history of atopy (asthma, eczema or rhinitis).\\n\\nViral infections: Lymphocytes predominate\\n\\nAllergic reactions: Eosinophils predominate\\n\\nVernal kerato conjunctivitis occurs mainly in hot climates and presents more often in young males.'}, page_content='Bacterial conjunctivitis is a highly contagious infection that causes redness, discharge, and swelling of the eye.
