Epidemiology Demographics, incidence and mortality In 2018, an estimated 2.1 million women were newly diagnosed with breast cancer, approximately one new case diagnosed every 18 seconds; additionally, 626,679 women with breast cancer died 3. The global incidence of breast cancer has been rising with annual increases of 3.1%, beginning with 641,000 cases in 1980 and increasing to >1.6 million in 2010 (reF.4); this trend is likely to continue. Indeed, the global cancer burden in women is increasing in countries regardless of income level, owing to popu lation growth and an ageing popu- lation. The female popu lation accounts for 49.5% of the global popu lation, and they form a larger proportion of the popu lation >60 years of age. Furthermore, the epidemio logy of advanced breast cancer is a research priority\\n\\n(2005). 39. Colditz, G. A., Sellers, T . A. & T rapido, E.
