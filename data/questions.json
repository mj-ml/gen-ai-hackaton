      "question": "What is breast cancer?",
      "answer": "Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. It typically forms a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer, too."
    },
    {
      "question": "How common is breast cancer?",
